CityBike Analysis

At first glance when looking at the data for End Stations (destination), it seems odd that one location, Grove St. PATH, is by far the most popular.  This can be explained by its location.  PATH is the rapid transit system that not only runs through New Jersey, but crosses into Manhattan.  It is safe to conclude that the majority of CityBike riders that end the trip at Grove St. PATH are using the bike to catch a train or bus.

As expected when the COVID-19 lockdown started in March of 2020, ridership was significanlty impacted.  The months of Jan and Feb 2020 showed an increase in usage from the same months in 2019.

A couple of strange phenomena were:

    During most hours of the day, especially peak hours in 2019 there were more rides started, except between the hours of 2PM to 5PM that actually had more rides started in 2020.

    CityBike categorizes the users as Customer (24-hour or 3-day pass user) and Subscriber (Annual Member).
    2020 actually had more users in the Customer category, especially from May through November vs that in 2019.
